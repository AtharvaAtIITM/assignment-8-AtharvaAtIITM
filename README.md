## Assignment Details

### Objective
This assignment will challenge you to apply and compare three primary ensemble techniques (Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking) to solve a complex, time-series-based regression problem. You will demonstrate your understanding of how these methods address model variance and bias, and how a diverse stack of models can yield superior performance to any single model.
